# Shiny textures branch

This is the branch of my minecraft bedrock texture pack that has new/shiny style textures, and is currently the most maintained branch.

Installation is currently compressing the "bedrock_PVPack" folder, and then changing the file extention from .zip to .mcpack, and then running it. Later I plan to make a batch and shell script to do this automatically, but there are none at this moment.

*I am currently not accepting pull requests, but would accept inspiration and constructive criticism
